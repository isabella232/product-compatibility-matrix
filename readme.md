# Pivotal Product Compatibility Matrix

Omnigraffle maintained by @slowestgirl.

## Setup
 1. Make sure you have [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?selection.family=Source+Sans+Pro) downloaded and installed before you open the file for editing.
 2. Make sure that Omnigraffle is saving as a flat file (should be set automatically).
 3. The docs pull the pdf file automatically, so it's fine to change the graffle file in draft stages because it won't go live on its own.
 4. When you need to make the PDF, use the `Export...` functionality in Omnigraffle rather than trying to print or save as a PDF.

## Nice to know

The product compatibility matrix is published:
+ https://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf
+ https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf

When editing the compatibility matrix,
make sure to follow [Best Practices for Updating the Matrix](https://docs-wiki.cfapps.io/wiki/knowledgebase/update-matrix.html#best-practices), or else we'll have your guts for garters.
